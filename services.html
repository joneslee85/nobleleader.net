          <h2>Workshops</h2>
          <p>All Workshops carry certification and the 3-day Residential Program results in participants becoming Noble Leader Ambassadors with the mission to uphold Noble Virtues and Aspirations particularly within the Workplace environment.</p>
          <p>The Workshops are modulated and can be delivered in accordance with client needs. Our Workshops symbolize the expression "Going beyond yourself". We believe that most of us are subject to many self destructive and negative qualities that hold us back from achieving true satisfaction and fulfilment in our work and life. Essentially we are "held back" by the subjective view that we hold of ourselves. We believe that we can free ourselves from the Self Destructive Behaviours and Outcomes that characterise our limitations and by embracing the Program Philosophy one can truly "Go Beyond the self" and thereby find direction and purpose and achieve greater self fulfilment.</p>

          <h2>Coaching and Mentoring</h2>
          <p>Noble Leader Facilitators will use the Program materials to help to define your objectives, clarify your skills and achievements, and instill within you a true sense of virtues and values and to achieve fulfillment. This is delivered in a structured way to meet your needs and where appropriate the needs of your employer. Often our Coaching and Mentoring service is delivered in conjunction with workplace funded professional development programs.</p>

          <h2>Career Management</h2>
          <p>Our skilled Coaches and Mentors will guide you into the Noble Leadership Career Management Plan. All executives at some stage should devote appropriate time, resources and energy to understanding their direction. Often we just drift from role to role without any clear structured plan. We work with you to provide both the structure and the plan and then through the implementation process. Our team has literally worked with thousands of executives and now we bring the Noble Leadership philosophy into the Career Management arena.</p>

        <section id='sensitive-outplacement'>
          <h2>Sensitive Outplacement</h2>
          <p>Outplacement can be one of the most difficult and troubling times for both the employer and the employee. By applying the Noble Leadership philosophy we work with both sides in a sensitive compassionate and caring manner. We will help the employer and the employee achieve a desirable outcome for the benefit of all parties. We then work with the outplaced executive to ensure a well balanced healthy approach to a successful return to the workforce.</p>
