          <h1>Committed to your highest virtues and aspirations</h1>
          <p>Our Philosophy recognizes that we can all cultivate our inherent qualities. Management is a skill that can be externally learnt but Leadership can come from within. We cultivate this via our "inside-out" approach. Anyone can be taught to be a Manager-some will be good Managers and others will be not. Leadership comes from within and when adopting our Philosophy you can become a Natural and Authentic Inspirational Leader and, by embracing the Program Philosophy one can truly "Go Beyond the self" and thereby find direction and purpose and achieve greater self fulfillment.</p>
          <p>All Programs and Workshops have a consistent theme to show that we all have the capability to become our own Leader and in so doing we can become more responsive, more efficient and effective with a greater clarity of purpose in all aspects of our lives.</p>

            <h3>The Productive Executive</h3>
            <p>This Program examines the obstacles to Workplace Efficiency and shows how we all lose productivity and fulfillment. We demonstrate the essential principles of Efficiency and how they can all be immediately applied into the Workplace. Efficiency is created by changing many of our inefficient workplace habits. Participants will learn how to overcome many Inefficient Habits including such obstacles as Procrastination and Distraction.</p>
            <p>We also examine the obstacles to Workplace Effectiveness. It is these obstacles that impact directly on our performance. Most people do not focus on the "big issues" or the "matters that count". They are busy being busy but not spending the right amount of time focused on the Issues that matter.</p>
            <p>This Program is devoted to understanding the issues and then the implementation back into the Workplace. We also provide a simple Workbook as a reminder to all participants.</p>

            <ul>
              <li class='red'>Greater level of comfort with each other</li>

            <h3>Aligning Corporate Values</h3>
            <p>One of the major contributors to declining workplace performance is a sense of employee disengagement.  Recent surveys show that around 60% of employees at all levels are not as engaged as they would like to be. Although there may be a number of personal reasons for this the biggest impact comes from the sense that "people do not feel aligned" to the company-they have lost their sense of belonging and as such performance suffers which may in turn lead to increased levels of stress and anxiety.</p>
            <p>This Program is specifically designed to maximize potential for all employees to fully embrace the Corporate Goals and Objectives and Cultural Values. These Programs are all aligned with the Corporate Employer prior to the Workshop. Our objective is designed to help employees align their own values and virtues with those of the organization thereby enthusing them with a renewed sense of purpose and objectivity. This Program is particularly effective within workplaces undergoing change where increased demands are placed on all people.</p>
